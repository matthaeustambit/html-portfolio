    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Self-made, balanced, and passionate about academics, sports, and leadership.</p>
    <p>Throughout high school, I took on multiple roles from captaining my school football team to representing my district in MSSD Hulu Langat (2022â€“2023), where we secured 2nd place in School Sports Week. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive recognitions such as a Silver Medal at the International Future Scientists Conference 2023 (IFSC) and an ASMO English Medal 2022. Beyond the classroom, Iâ€™ve served as Scout Treasurer, Multimedia Committee Member for the Entrepreneurship Club, served as a secretary for my Espots Club, and ranked in the Top 18 at Schools Cross Campus (2023). I recently completed my Foundation in Applied Science under the ASASIpintar Programme at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), where I was actively involved in research projects, seminars, and innovation competitions. I would like to mention that my team managed to secure a Silver Medal for Pertandingan Inovasi Antara Asasi Malaysia 2025 (PITRAM).</p>
    <p>I stay active with sports and fitness because it keeps me disciplined and grounded.</p>

      <h4>Calculator</h4>
      <p>Say hello to my Python calculator where every byte couns. Every coder starts with a calculator but I included a square root in mine which obviously makes it much better. Basically does basic mathematics with enhancements as mentioned earlier, square roots... Just another beginner calculator.</p>

      <h4>Personal Website</h4>
      <p>A personal portfolio website built by myself to showcase a little bit about myself, achievements, and the projects that I have worked on. It is minimalistic and easy to navigate just the way I like it. Far from lavish, itâ€™s intentionally minimalistic and streamlined. </p>
